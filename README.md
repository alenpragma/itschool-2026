# Edulife IT School — multi-page site

A production-ready, multi-page static site built from a single-page design, structured so a
developer can drop a dynamic backend underneath it without touching the markup.

- **Design language:** cream canvas · navy ink · teal primary · amber / coral accents
- **Typography:** Fraunces (display serif) + Manrope (UI sans)
- **Pages:** Home · About Us · Admission · Teachers · Notice · Events · Gallery · Blog · Contact · 404
- **Detail pages:** one per item, generated from the JSON — `blog/<slug>.html`,
  `notice/<slug>.html`, `event/<slug>.html`, plus the runtime `article.html?type=&slug=` route
- **No framework, no build toolchain required** — one small Node script assembles the pages.
- **Host configs included:** `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` (GitHub Pages),
  `netlify.toml`, `vercel.json` — see §3.

### Why `src/` and `dist/` are separate

`src/` holds everything you edit. `scripts/build.js` wraps each page body in
`src/layouts/base.html`, injects the generated header/footer and renders every
`{{BLOCK_*}}` placeholder from `src/data/*.json`, then writes the finished site to
`dist/`. **`dist/` is a build artifact** — it is gitignored, it is wiped and
regenerated on every build, and hand edits to it are lost. That separation is what
lets you review source, not generated markup, and what stops a renamed page from
surviving as a stale file that still resolves.

On a clean checkout, nothing in the repo root is a deployable page: the root holds only
sources, configs and tooling, and every host config publishes **`dist/`**.

> **This archive ships with a pre-built root snapshot.** So that the download works the
> moment it is unzipped — open `index.html` and the site renders, no Node required — the
> built output has *also* been laid down at the archive root (`index.html`, `assets/`,
> `blog/`, `notice/`, `event/`, `data/`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`). Those copies are
> the same bytes as `dist/` and carry the same `?v=` stamp.
>
> **They are generated, not source.** Editing them is pointless: the next `npm run build`
> writes to `dist/` only, so your root copies go stale. Either publish `dist/` (the
> configured behaviour) or re-sync the root after a build:
>
> ```bash
> npm run build && cp -r dist/. .
> ```
>
> Before committing to Git, delete the root snapshot (`rm -f *.html sitemap.xml robots.txt
> && rm -rf assets blog notice event data`) and keep `dist/` gitignored, as `.gitignore`
> expects.

## 2. Routing model

Plain multi-page routing. One URL = one file, no client-side router, so the site is
crawlable, works on any static host, and opens correctly from `file://`.

| Route | File | Nav key |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `index.html` | `home` |
| `/about.html` | `about.html` | `about` |
| `/admission.html` | `admission.html` | `admission` |
| `/teachers.html` | `teachers.html` | `teachers` |
| `/notice.html` | `notice.html` | `notice` |
| `/events.html` | `events.html` | `events` |
| `/gallery.html` | `gallery.html` | `gallery` |
| `/blog.html` | `blog.html` | `blog` |
| `/contact.html` | `contact.html` | `contact` |
| `/blog/:slug` | `blog/<slug>.html` | `blog` |
| `/notice/:slug` | `notice/<slug>.html` | `notice` |
| `/event/:slug` | `event/<slug>.html` | `events` |
| `/article.html?type=&slug=` | `article.html` | (set at runtime) |
| (any 404) | `404.html` | `404` |

The **nav key** lives on `<body data-page="…">` and is the only thing that determines
which nav item gets `class="active"`. Links in `data/site.json > nav` are plain relative
`.html` paths, so nothing needs rewriting when you deploy under a sub-path.

> **Moving to clean URLs** (`/about` instead of `/about.html`) means changing the `href`
> values in `data/site.json > nav`, `footer.columns` and any in-page link, then
> configuring rewrites on your host. All the hrefs come from one place, so it is a
> search-and-replace, not a refactor.

### Detail routes (single blog post · notice · event)

Every blog post, notice and event has **its own page**. The pattern is identical
across the three families and each family is a folder:

| Route | File on disk | Source | Slug field |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/blog/:slug` | `blog/<slug>.html` | `data/blog.json` → `items[]` | `slug` |
| `/notice/:slug` | `notice/<slug>.html` | `data/notices.json` → `items[]` | `slug` |
| `/event/:slug` | `event/<slug>.html` | `data/events.json` → `items[]` | `slug` |

All three use **one template**, `pages/detail.html`. It carries a single token,
`{{DETAIL_CONTENT}}`, which `build.js` fills by calling
`renderers.js → renderDetail(type, item, ctx)`. No article markup is written by
hand and there is no per-type template to drift out of sync. The item's siblings
in the same array supply the previous/next pager and the related grid, so nothing
is duplicated in the JSON.

> Detail pages are one level deep, so their asset and link paths need a `../`.
> `build.js` applies this automatically: the generated page is run through
> `rebase(html, 1)`, which prefixes every site-root-relative `href`/`src` (and
> `og:image`) and leaves absolute URLs, `#` anchors and already-relative paths
> alone. Never hand-write paths in a detail template.

#### Two entry points, one template

| Entry point | What it is | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| `blog/<slug>.html` etc. | a real, static file per item | crawlable, shareable, works with no JavaScript |
| `article.html?type=&slug=` | one URL that can serve any item | the shape a dynamic backend needs |

`assets/js/article.js` powers the second: it reads `?type=` and `?slug=`, loads
that family through `data-loader.js`, finds the matching item and renders it with
the *same* detail renderers. A missing or unknown slug produces an honest
not-found panel with real links onward, never a blank page.

#### Converting to clean, backend-owned routes

Point your host's rewrite rules at the runtime entry:

| Rewrite | To |
|---|---|
| `/blog/:slug` | `/article.html?type=blog&slug=:slug` |
| `/notice/:slug` | `/article.html?type=notice&slug=:slug` |
| `/event/:slug` | `/article.html?type=event&slug=:slug` |

Then tell the renderers to emit extensionless links:

```js
EDU.render.setLinkBase('/');   // blog/<slug>.html  →  /blog/<slug>
```

That one call updates `detailHref()` for the listing cards, the pager and the
related grid at once. Everything else stays as it is.

#### How to add a new post, notice or event

1. **Add one object** to the right array in `data/`:

   ```json
   {
     "slug": "my-new-post",
     "title": "My new post",
     "category": "Parenting",
     "date": "2026-10-20",
     "dateLabel": "20 Oct 2026",
     "readTime": "4 min read",
     "author": "Nusrat Jahan",
     "authorRole": "English & Phonetics",
     "authorImage": "assets/images/t-sadia.jpg",
     "tags": ["Reading"],
     "image": "assets/images/u-reading.jpg",
     "alt": "Description of the image",
     "excerpt": "One-sentence summary, used on cards and in search results.",
     "body": [
       { "type": "lead", "text": "An opening paragraph in a larger serif face." },
       { "type": "p", "text": "Body copy." },
       { "type": "h2", "text": "A section heading" },
       { "type": "list", "items": ["First point", "Second point"] }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Rebuild**: `node build.js && cp -r .build/* .`  
   A page appears at `blog/my-new-post.html`, its listing card links to it, and
   the item automatically joins its siblings' pager and related grid. No route
   registration, no template edit.

3. **Notices and events** take the same shape with their own extra fields:
   notices add `priority` (`Normal` · `Important` · `Urgent`), `department`,
   `audience[]`, `day`, `monthYear`; events add `day`, `month`, `monthYear`,
   `venue`, `time`, `endTime`, `audience[]`, `registration` and an optional
   `agenda[]` of `{ "time", "item" }`.

#### The article body contract

`body` is an array of blocks. This is the complete vocabulary — add a `case` to
`detailBody()` in `renderers.js` to extend it:

| `type` | Fields | Renders as |
|---|---|---|
| `lead` | `text` | opening paragraph, larger serif, amber rule |
| `p` | `text` | body paragraph |
| `h2` | `text` | section heading |
| `h3` | `text` | sub-heading |
| `list` | `items[]` | bulleted list |
| `quote` | `text`, `cite` | dark pull-quote with attribution |
| `callout` | `title`, `text` | amber highlighted aside |
| `image` | `image`, `alt`, `caption` | full-width figure |

Every block and every card passes through `esc()`, so text typed by a person can
never inject markup.

## 3. Build & deploy

```bash
cd edulife-it-school
npm run build      # node scripts/build.js → wipes and rebuilds dist/
                   #   dist/*.html, blog|notice|event/<slug>.html,
                   #   assets/, data/, robots.txt, sitemap.xml
npm run check      # node scripts/check.js → the quality gate
npm run dev        # node scripts/serve.js → preview dist/ at localhost:3000

npm run verify     # build + check in one step (what CI runs)
```

`npm install` is only needed for `npm run lint` / `npm run format`; the build,
preview and quality gate use nothing but Node built-ins.

### 3.1 Deploy — GitHub Pages

The site is built with **relative URLs only** — `assets/css/styles.css`, `about.html`,
`blog/<slug>.html` — and there is **not a single root-absolute `/assets/...` reference
anywhere** (verified: 0 occurrences). So it works at a domain root *and* at a **sub-path**
such as `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` with **no configuration change**. Do **not** add a
`<base href>` tag — it would break the relative `blog/` / `notice/` routes.

A ready-made workflow ships at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.

- **Option A (recommended):** **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**, then push to `main`.
- **Option B:** **Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → `main` / `/` (root)** —
  works because the built pages are committed, so GitHub runs nothing.

For production, make `sitemap.xml` `<loc>` values absolute *including* the sub-path.

### 3.2 Deploy — Netlify

Configured by **`netlify.toml`** at the project root; no dashboard settings needed.

1. **New site from Git** → pick the repo.
2. Netlify reads `netlify.toml`: `publish = "dist"` and command `node scripts/build.js`
   (Node 20). Nothing else to set — no `npm install` step, no environment variables.

The file also sets long-lived `immutable` caching for `/assets/*` (safe because the build
stamps every CSS/JS URL with a content hash, `?v=<hash>`), `must-revalidate` for HTML/JSON,
and rewrites so `/blog/<slug>`, `/notice/<slug>`, `/event/<slug>` and `/article` resolve
alongside the real `.html` files, with a `404.html` fallback.

### 3.3 Deploy — Vercel

Configured by **`vercel.json`** at the project root.

1. **Import the repo** → Framework Preset **Other**.
2. Vercel reads `vercel.json` (`framework: null`, build command `node scripts/build.js`,
   `outputDirectory: "dist"`, `cleanUrls: true`). Nothing else to set.

It carries the same asset cache headers, the same three detail-route rewrites, and `cleanUrls`
so `/about` works as well as `/about.html`.

### 3.4 Any other host

S3 + CloudFront, nginx, Cloudflare Pages and friends behave the same way: serve this folder as
the document root and point the 404 handler at `404.html`. `sitemap.xml` ships with **relative**
`<loc>` values — rewrite them to absolute URLs before submitting.

---

## 4. How to add a page

1. **Create the body** — copy an existing file in `src/pages/`, e.g. `src/pages/academics.html`.
   Keep the `.page-hero` block at the top for a consistent entry point.

2. **Register it** in `build.js`, in the `PAGES` array:

   ```js
   { src: 'academics.html', out: 'academics.html', key: 'academics',
     title: 'Academics — Edulife IT School',
     description: 'Curriculum, subjects and how learning is organised.' }
   ```

   `key` must match a `nav[].key` in `data/site.json` if you want the nav item highlighted.

3. **Add it to the navigation** — `data/site.json > nav` (this feeds both the desktop nav
   and the mobile drawer), and to `footer.columns` if it belongs there.

4. **Add a new list?** Add the JSON in `src/data/`, add a renderer in
   `assets/js/renderers.js`, register the view in `assets/js/data-loader.js > VIEWS`,
   and add a `BLOCK_*` entry in `build.js`:

   ```js
   BLOCK_SUBJECTS: () => R.renderList(data.subjects, R.subjectCard)
   ```

   Then reference `{{BLOCK_SUBJECTS}}` from the page body.

5. Rebuild: `npm run build`

> **Adding a blog post, notice or event is different** from adding a page — you
> never touch `pages/` at all. You add one object with a `slug` and a `body` to
> the matching JSON file, and `build.js` generates the page. See
> *Detail routes → How to add a new post, notice or event* above.

---

## 5. Connecting a backend / CMS

The site is designed so this is a **configuration change, not a rewrite**.

### Step 1 — the data contract

Every source maps to one endpoint. JSON files and REST responses have identical shapes.

| Source | Static file | List endpoint | Detail endpoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Site / global | `data/site.json` | `GET /site` | — |
| Teachers | `data/teachers.json` | `GET /teachers` | — |
| Notices | `data/notices.json` | `GET /notices` | `GET /notices/:slug` |
| Events | `data/events.json` | `GET /events` | `GET /events/:slug` |
| Gallery | `data/gallery.json` | `GET /gallery` | — |
| Blog | `data/blog.json` | `GET /blog` | `GET /blog/:slug` |

### Step 2 — switch the loader over

Edit the `config` block at the top of `assets/js/data-loader.js`:

```js
var config = {
  useStaticJson: false,                          // ← was true
  dataDir: 'data/',
  apiBase: 'https://api.your-school.example/v1', // ← your backend
  endpoints: {
    site:     { json: 'site.json',     api: '/site' },
    teachers: { json: 'teachers.json', api: '/teachers' },
    notices:  { json: 'notices.json',  api: '/notices' },
    events:   { json: 'events.json',   api: '/events' },
    gallery:  { json: 'gallery.json',  api: '/gallery' },
    blog:     { json: 'blog.json',     api: '/blog' }
  }
};
```

### Step 3 — mark up the page as live

Each list container already declares where it gets its content from:

```html
<div class="teachers"
     data-source="teachers"    <!-- endpoint key        -->
     data-pick="staff"         <!-- path into payload   -->
     data-view="teachers"      <!-- renderer name       -->
     data-limit="8">           <!-- optional cap        -->
  …pre-rendered cards…         <!-- shipped by the build -->
</div>
```

Set the page live with `<body data-live="true">` (a token in `layouts/base.html`). The
loader then fetches each source once, renders through the renderer named by `data-view`,
and replaces only the container's children.

**Graceful degradation is built in:** because `build.js` already wrote real cards into
every list, the page is complete and indexable before JavaScript runs. If the API is slow
or down, the loader logs the error and leaves the build-time markup in place — a failed
request never blanks a page.

### Step 4 — form submissions

Both forms (`admission.html`, `contact.html`) are **client-side demos** carrying
`data-validate`; they validate in the browser and store nothing. To post them for real,
add an action and a fetch call in the `initForms()` handler in `assets/js/main.js`:

```js
fetch('/api/admission', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(Object.fromEntries(new FormData(form)))
}).then(/* show .form-success */);
```

The success banner (`.form-success`) and its styles already exist.

> ⚠️ Never point these forms at a third-party relay or a mailbox you do not control.

---

## 6. Theming

All design decisions live in the `:root` block at the top of `assets/css/styles.css`:

```css
--ink:#101B2D;        /* navy — headings, footer, dark panels */
--cream:#FBF7F0;      /* page canvas */
--teal:#0E7C6B;       /* primary actions, links, accents */
--amber:#F5A524;      /* highlight, accents */
--coral:#E4572E;      /* secondary accent, form errors */
--radius / --radius-lg / --shadow-* / --maxw / --ease
```

Change those and the whole site re-themes. Fonts are loaded once in `layouts/base.html`.

### Closing CTA (`.cta-sec` / `.cta-cols`) — homepage

The closing band came back in v9, redesigned as a **two-column panel** driven entirely by
`data/site.json → cta`.

| Column | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `.cta-left` | eyebrow, headline, intro line, then the **address / contact list** (both campuses, phone, email, office hours) |
| `.cta-right` | a short lead line, the trust hook, then the actions — **Apply for admission** (`.btn-amber`) and **Book a campus visit** (`.btn-ghost`) |

**The equal-height rule — do not "simplify" it.** The brief requires the two columns to end on
the same line, so `.cta-cols` is a **CSS grid with `align-items:stretch`** and each column carries
**`height:100%`**. The grid sizes both columns to the tallest one and the shorter column's card
fills the remainder. No fixed height, no JS measurement, correct at every viewport. Two things
keep it honest:

- `align-items:stretch` is written out explicitly even though it is the grid default — it is the
  mechanism, so it must survive future edits.
- Below **860px** the grid collapses to one column (`.cta-cols{grid-template-columns:1fr}`) and
  `height:100%` becomes a no-op. **Equal height stops applying on purpose** — once the columns are
  stacked there is nothing to align, and forcing a shared height would only create empty space.

**Keep the right column's content in ONE `.cta-end` block (v12 fix).** The lead line, the trust
hook and the buttons live inside a single `.cta-end` wrapper that is bottom-anchored with
`margin-top:auto`. Do **not** put `margin-top:auto` on `.cta-actions` instead: that pins only the
buttons to the bottom and lets the lead + trust line stay at the top, opening a ~330px dead gap
between "Ready when you are." and the primary button at 1280/1440 — exactly the defect v12 fixed.
Anchoring the whole block keeps the three lines 18px apart while still ending flush with the address
column's last row.

**One CTA, not two (v12 fix).** The homepage used to carry the closing-CTA copy twice: once in the
"Admission teaser" (`.pad-sm` + `.admission-grid` + `.campus-card`, with its own "Begin your
Edulife story" eyebrow, "Give your child a stronger start." headline and a "Book a campus visit"
button) and again in this `.cta-sec` panel. The teaser was removed from `pages/index.html`; the
`.cta-sec` panel is now the homepage's only closing CTA. `.admission-grid` / `.campus-card` are
**still used** by `pages/contact.html` and `pages/admission.html`, so their CSS must stay.

Editing the copy: change `cta.*` in `data/site.json` and rebuild. The contact rows read from
`contact` / `campuses`, so they stay in sync with the rest of the site.

### The Edulife family (`.ini-sec` / `.initiatives`) — homepage

The section directly below the closing CTA lists the other initiatives: **Edulife IT, Edulife
Agency, Edulife Kids, Edulife Publications, FoodLife, Edulife Tech**.

Content lives in `data/site.json → initiatives`:

```json
{
  "eyebrow": "The Edulife family",
  "title": "More than a school.",
  "text": "…",
  "items": [
    { "id": "edulife-it", "icon": "cap",
      "logo": "assets/images/initiatives/edulife-it.png", "alt": "Edulife IT logo",
      "name": "Edulife IT", "tagline": "…",
      "url": "https://example.com/edulife-it",
      "href": "index.html", "tone": "teal" }
  ]
}
```

`initiativeCard()` in `assets/js/renderers.js` renders each entry as a single `<a>` tile (so the
whole card is the tap target): a **PNG/JPG logo** on a tone-tinted 52px plate, the name, the
one-line `tagline`, and an arrow.

**Logos — this is where you put your real brand marks.**

- Drop the files in `src/assets/images/initiatives/` and point at them with `logo`.
- Square works best; ~192px is plenty for a 26px rendered size. **Transparent PNG is ideal**, since
the plate already supplies the tint. A non-square or JPG logo still renders correctly
(`object-fit:contain`), it just sits smaller inside the plate.
- The shipped six are **placeholder marks** drawn in the site palette, not the real logos. Replace
the files in place — no code change needed.
- `alt` is kept in the data for editors and for any future image you *do* want described. In the
card it is deliberately rendered as `alt=""` (decorative), because the **initiative name is real
text directly beside the image** — a described logo plus a visible name would be announced twice.

**Fallback.** `icon` names a mark in the icon set (`cap`, `pen`, `balloon`, `pages`, `apple`,
`chip`) and is used only when `logo` is blank or the file is missing, so a bad path can never
render an empty plate. An unknown `icon` name falls back to a star.

**Links.** `url` is the initiative's own website and wins over `href`. `href` is an in-site page used
when `url` is blank. http(s) targets automatically get `target="_blank"` +
`rel="noopener noreferrer"` and an `.sr-only` "(opens in a new tab)" hint, so the new tab is
announced rather than sprung on the visitor; in-site targets stay plain links. No `aria-label` is
used — it would replace the accessible name and swallow the tagline.

**Sizing.** The plate is `52px` with a `26px` logo (`48px` / `24px` at ≤620px). Both the plate and
the `<img>` are sized explicitly, and the `<img>` also carries `width`/`height` attributes, so the
browser reserves the box before the file loads and the cards cannot shift as logos arrive.

**Keyboard + hover.** Cards lift on hover and show the same lift plus a 2px teal ring on
`:focus-visible`, so keyboard users get parity without a ring sticking after a mouse click.

**Adding an initiative** needs one data object plus one image — no markup changes. Run
`npm run build`, done.

- Grid: **3 columns** desktop → **2 columns** at ≤1024px → **1 column** at ≤620px.
- The container carries the usual `data-source` / `data-pick` / `data-view` attributes, so it can
  be hydrated from the API later exactly like every other list on the site (see §6).
- Visually distinct from the footer (light cards on cream, its own section heading) while reusing
  the same card radius, border and shadow tokens.

### Classes we offer (`.classes-sec` / `.classes`) — Admission page

The Admission page lists the seven classes the school admits into — **Nursery, Junior One, Class
One, Class Two, Class Three, Class Four, Class Five** — as a grid of level cards, placed after the
admission steps and before the FAQ so it reads as part of the admission journey.

Content lives in `data/site.json → classes`:

```json
{
  "eyebrow": "Classes we offer",
  "title": "Seven classes, one clear path.",
  "text": "…",
  "badge": "Nursery to Class Five",
  "items": [
    { "id": "nursery", "mark": "N", "name": "Nursery", "age": "Age 3–4",
      "focus": "…", "tone": "teal" }
  ]
}
```

`classCard()` in `assets/js/renderers.js` renders each entry as a card carrying a large Fraunces
**level mark** (`mark`) tinted by `tone` (`teal` / `amber` / `coral`), an **age chip**, the class
name and a one-line `focus`. **Adding or renaming a class needs no markup** — edit the array, run
`node build.js`, done.

- Grid: **4 columns** desktop → **2 columns** at ≤1024px → **1 column** at ≤620px. The breakpoints
  are explicit rather than `auto-fit`, so the seven cards always break into tidy rows instead of
  leaving a single orphan on a wide screen.
- The container carries the usual `data-source` / `data-pick` / `data-view` attributes, so it can
  be hydrated from the API later exactly like every other list on the site (see §6).
- The admission inquiry form's **Class** dropdown lists the same seven levels — keep the two in
  sync when a class is added.

## 7. Accessibility & behaviour notes

- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` — all reveal/float/marquee animation is disabled.
- Print stylesheet hides nav, drawer, scrim, progress bar, decorations and the chat widget.
- The mobile drawer is a proper `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal` panel: focus moves into it on
  open, is trapped while open (Tab/Shift+Tab cycle inside), returns to the hamburger on close,
  and it closes on Escape, scrim tap, the close button or a nav link. The page behind it is
  scroll-locked without losing the reading position (`position:fixed` + saved offset).
- Gallery tiles are keyboard reachable (`tabindex`, Enter opens the lightbox, Escape closes).
- Filter chips carry `aria-pressed`; empty filter results show an explicit message
  rather than a blank grid.
- Icon-only controls (`burger`, `drawerClose`, `toTop`, lightbox close) all have `aria-label`.

## 8. Known follow-ups for a real launch

- `sitemap.xml` uses relative URLs — make them absolute on deploy.
- The brand lockup is the **full horizontal logo** (emblem *plus* wordmark) as a single
  **300×100 PNG**, used in the header, the mobile drawer and the footer. Two variants exist:

  | File | Ink | Used by |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `src/assets/images/logo-full.png` | brand blue | header (cream background) |
  | `src/assets/images/logo-full-light.png` | cream | footer + drawer (navy background) |

  Both are transparent, exactly **300×100**, and derived from the official
  `logo-lockup.png`. The `<img>` declares `width="300" height="100"` so the browser
  reserves the box before load (no layout shift), while CSS sizes it by **height**
  with `width:auto` via `.brand-logo`, which preserves the 3:1 ratio automatically:
  48px tall in the header, 52px in the footer, 40px in the drawer, dropping to 40/44px
  under 760px. Because the wordmark is part of the artwork, there is no adjacent
  text markup in the `.brand` element — the `alt` carries the full name.
  The circular `logo-seal.png` remains in place as the **favicon** only.
  For a production icon set, generate 16/32/180/512px PNGs plus an `.ico` from the seal.
  **To drop in your own lockup**, replace `logo-full.png` (and the light variant) with
  your own 3:1 PNG — no code change needed, though non-3:1 artwork should keep
  `object-fit:contain` so it letterboxes rather than distorts.
- Press logos and permit scans are placeholders — swap in licensed assets. They now appear
  **only on the About page**; the homepage "Official recognition" section was removed, so the
  `.trust` / `.permit` / `.press` styles are shared with About and must not be deleted.
- Contact details (`+880 1800 000000`, `hello@edulife.edu.bd`) are placeholders.
- The runtime detail route (`article.html?type=&slug=`) sets its own title and
  description client-side. Once you serve real dynamic routes, have the backend
  render `<title>` / `<meta name="description">` for the item so crawlers and
  social scrapers see the right values without running JavaScript.
- `blog.html` etc. still render every item at build time. When you connect an
  API, mark those pages `data-live="true"` so the lists hydrate from the
  endpoint (the static markup stays as the no-JS fallback).

## 9. Live chat (tawk.to)

Every page of the site loads `assets/js/chat.js`, which embeds the **tawk.to** live-chat
widget. tawk.to is a free live-chat / helpdesk service: a small chat bubble appears
bottom-right on every page, visitors type a message, and staff reply from a dashboard or
the phone app. The free plan covers unlimited agents, unlimited concurrent chats and one
website property — enough for a school office.

**✅ The widget is now CONFIGURED and live site-wide.** The real IDs are already in
place:

```js
var TAWK_PROPERTY_ID = '6ace6f47d0f2b934caf86b75';   /* Property ID */
var TAWK_WIDGET_ID   = '1k4r65co4';                   /* Widget ID   */
```

which loads the standard embed at `https://embed.tawk.to/6ace6f47d0f2b934caf86b75/1k4r65co4`.
The chat bubble appears bottom-right on every page.

### Change the IDs later (or move to a new tawk.to property)

1. **Find your IDs:** `Administration → Channels → Chat Widget → Direct Chat Link`.
   The link looks like this:

   ```
   https://tawk.to/chat/6a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f/1i2j3k4l
                       └──── PROPERTY ID ─────┘ └ WIDGET ID ┘
   ```
2. **Paste those two values** into `assets/js/chat.js` — the top of the file is a
   clearly marked config block, and these are the only two lines you touch:

   ```js
   var TAWK_PROPERTY_ID = '6ace6f47d0f2b934caf86b75';   /* ← Property ID */
   var TAWK_WIDGET_ID   = '1k4r65co4';                   /* ← Widget ID   */
   ```

   For the link above that would be the `6a1b…0e1f` part and the `1i2j…k4l` part.
3. **Rebuild** so the new script is stamped into every page: `npm run build`
   (chat.js is part of the cache-busting hash, so editing it changes the `?v=` stamp
   on every page. The build rewrites the whole of `dist/`, detail folders included.)

> **Safety net:** if the constants are ever left as placeholders (starting with `TAWK_`),
> `chat.js` loads nothing at all — no widget, no console errors, no failing requests — so
> a typo can never break the site, it just silently disables chat.

### How the school answers chats

- **Dashboard:** log in at <https://dashboard.tawk.to/> — the *Inbox* shows live chats and
  the messaging history.
- **Mobile app:** install the free **tawk.to** app (iOS / Android) and sign in with the same
  account; replies can be sent from the phone.
- **While nobody is online**, tawk.to shows an offline form and emails the transcript, so no
  enquiry is lost.

### Layout notes

- `chat.js` pins the bubble at `z-index: 1090`, deliberately **below** the mobile drawer
  (`z-index: 1100`), so an open menu is never covered by the chat bubble.
- On phones the back-to-top button is moved to the **bottom-left** (see the `max-width:560px`
  block in `styles.css`) so it can never overlap the bottom-right chat bubble.
- The widget is hidden in print stylesheets.
- To change the bubble's corner or offset, edit the `Tawk_API.customStyle.visibility` block
  in `chat.js` (`br` = bottom-right, `bl` = bottom-left, etc.).
